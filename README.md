# Snake
A classic version of the Snake game built in week 3.

A challenge to recreate Snake in JS as an introduction to classes and OOP. The game is made using cells and a table, the snake's body made of a sequence of cells that lengthens after eating red cells. The game boundary wraps, allowing the player to play with greater flexibility. The snake detects whether it has eaten itself and ends the game. Features a scoreboard.
